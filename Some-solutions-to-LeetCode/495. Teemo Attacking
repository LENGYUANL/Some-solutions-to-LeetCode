Description：
Input: [1,2], 2
Output: 3
Explanation: At time point 1, Teemo starts attacking Ashe and makes Ashe be poisoned. 
This poisoned status will last 2 seconds until the end of time point 2. 
However, at the beginning of time point 2, Teemo attacks Ashe again who is already in poisoned status. 
Since the poisoned status won't add up together, though the second poisoning attack will still work at time point 2, it will stop at the end of time point 3. 
So you finally need to output 3.

//就只要判断一下前一项+duration之后是否超过下一项即可，easy.
public class Solution {
    public int findPoisonedDuration(int[] time, int duration) {
        if (time.length == 0 || time == null) return 0;
        int res = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < time.length-1; i++){
            if (time[i] + duration <= time[i+1]){
                res += duration;
            }else res += time[i+1] - time[i];
        }
        return res+duration;
    }
}
